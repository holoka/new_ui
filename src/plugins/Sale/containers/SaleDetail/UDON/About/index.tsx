					Udonex is the governance token of the decentralized and centralized exchange Udonex, built on the Binance Smart Chain network. Udonex Token is a BEP-20 Standard token.
					<br />
					<br />
					Udonex is a decentralized exchange protocol that works without an order book. Instead of an order book, Udonex uses a model called Automated Market-Making (AMM), in which liquidity providers add funds to liquidity pools. Despite being an exchange with Japanese design, anyone regardless of origin can be part of the protocol. In addition, holders of the Udonex token will be able to use it within the decentralized exchange to increase their earnings in the form of liquidity mining / yield farming.
